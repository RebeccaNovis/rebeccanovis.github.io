                    <p>Hi, I'm Rebecca Novis! I graduated May 2025 from Boise State University with a BS of Science in
                        Games, Interactive Media, and Mobile Technology (GIMM).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am an experienced Full Stack Web Developer with a passion for frontend development. I
                        specialize
                        in building responsive, user-friendly, and robust web applications by leveraging my expertise in
                        both frontend and backend technologies. In addition to web development, I also have a background
                        in game development, working with both Unity and Unreal Engine to bring interactive experiences
                        to life. I thrive on tackling creative challenges and continuously pushing my skills to new
                        heights, no matter the project.

                        of your base in order to reach the safety of the Star Bay. Along the way, you are expected to
                        collect stars, avoid meteors, and continue moving before the wreckage of the base falls
                        away from you.</p>

                    <p>This was my first video game I developed independently in Unity. Through this project,
                        I learned much about using Unity and programming in C#, as I was only somewhat
                        familiar with Unity and C# prior to making this game. I created several different
                        game mechanics for this game, including platforms that fall away after the player
                        collides with them, meteors that damage the player, and a key item the player must
                        collect in order to complete the second level. I had difficulty making each mechanic
                        work properly, but with each new addition I made to my game, my understanding of Unity and C#
                        grew.

                    <p>The first mechanic I implemented was the falling platforms. While I can look back at
                        my code now and recognize its simplicity, I in fact spent several hours researching how
                        to get the desired outcome. The result was the script FallingPlatform, in which I
                        created a function called killIt() that disables the platform’s rigidbody’s isKinematic
                        by setting it to false, allowing the platform to be affected by the physics of the
                        scene. Then, after half a second, the platform is destroyed. This function is invoked
                        two seconds after the player collides with the platform. This gives the player two
                        seconds to jump off the platform before it falls away from under them. For a closer look at on
                        the code for this project, you can view my Github repository for the game <a

                        Aside from coding, I also drew four sprites in Procreate: the meteorites, the buildings
                        you enter at the end of each level, and the nebula key. The yellow and red collectable stars
                        were created in Photoshop.

                        Creating <i>Star Bay</i> was a challenging endeavor, but I am proud of creating a fun and

                    <p>This project was the result of a collaborative effort to create an interactive comic about a
                        prompt given to us by our professor: the bilinear flow of time. A bilinear flow of time is
                        a theory from quantum physics, and essentially boils down to the idea that time flows
                        both forwards and backwards. In other words: the future affects the past just as much
                        as the past affects the future. With such a broad and complex topic, the group and I
                        initially struggled to decide on what our comic should be about, and how to best add
                        interactivity in order to connect to the stories' themes and concepts.

                        We tossed around many ideas throughout our initial meetings, with the gameplay and story
                        frequently
                        changing and evolving. Some of our initial ideas included the main character using a clock to
                        navigate
                        through time and drawing the comic in a circular format so it could be read in any direction.
                        However,
                        as we continued to talk about and work on the interactive comic, our concept for it continued to
                        shift
                        until the final product was finished. Even our storyboard made using Adobe XD, while mostly true
                        to the
                        final product, still contains some ideas left in there that never made it into our final
                        project.

                    <p>I had a lot of fun coming up with ideas for this project, especially since concepts related to
                        time
                        loops, time travel, and the general nature of time are particularly compelling to me. While
                        working on this
                        project, two pieces of media that I drew a lot of inspiration from were the movies <i>Tenet</i>
                        (2020) and
                        <i>Arrival</i> (2016), and the way they each handled the flow of time. The video game
                        <i>Braid</i> was another
                        core inspiration for me, particularly in how the final level demonstrated that by changing the
                        flow of time,
                        the context of events happening shifted drastically.

                        <i>Pursuit of Time</i> does not have a huge plot twist like the above stories.
                        Instead, it takes a much more mundane approach to the concept of a bilinear flow of time,
                        asking what we can learn from and embrace about it in our day to day lives. Thinking about
                        these stories in relation to my own life experiences led me to push for the main theme of our
                        game:
                        that time may be uncertain, but by embracing life moment by moment it becomes easier to
                        navigate.

                    <p>I wrote and drew two comics for <i>Pursuit of Time</i>, one set in Janus’ past,
                        and another in her future. I am much more practiced in creative writing than I am in
                        illustration,
                        but I am happy with how the two comics strips I created turned out, as I believe they
                        effectively
                        convey the ideas I was aiming for.

                        I had a minimal role in the programming for this project, but whenever bugs or unexpected issues
                        arose in our
                        Unity project, I assisted in troubleshooting and fixing the problems.

                    <p>Sustainability and Systems Thinking In Chemistry Education (SaSTICE) is a website intended to
                        provide information
                        and resources to chemistry educators on how to incorporate systems thinking into their teaching.
                        I was brought
                        onto a small team working professionally for the International Union of Pure and Applied
                        Chemistry (IUPAC) to
                        begin development for this website from February 2023 until April 2023. I worked on this website
                        alongside two other students, Gamma Gamel and
                        Carson McMahan, and my professor, Jack Polifka. My primary contributions to the website involved
                        user experience testing,
                        as well as creating a mockup design.
                    </p>

            <div class='row'>
                <div class='col-md-7'>
                    <p>As part of my work, I created a mockup for the website using Adobe XD, which can be viewed
                        <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/ecac8c14-f9b8-4180-8ef1-941dcfe928f4-b9ff/?fullscreen"

                        Each of the other members of the team created a mockup of their own as well, and sought feedback
                        from the
                        client about what they liked and disliked about each one. The client noted that they liked the
                        look and
                        format of the search page and projects page in my mockup. However, they did not like how much I
                        leaned into
                        the IUPAC’s branding, particularly in regards to the colorscheme. In addition to the feedback
                        received on my
                        teammate’s mockups, the four of us were able to get greater insight into what the clients wanted
                        from the website.

                        <p>Our team also performed user experience testing and research in order to decide the
                            organization of the
                            navigation bar for the website. To do this, we first asked our clients to provide us with a
                            list of the
                            various pages they planned to display on the SaSTICE website. With the list of navigation
                            categories from
                            our client, we first wanted to simplify the names of each item, as several included jargon
                            that may have
                            made navigation more difficult. To do this, we provided a survey to various educators at
                            Boise State
                            University, asking them how they would simplify the phrasing given to us by the client. This
                            allowed us
                            to ensure that the language used made sense to the target demographic of the website.

                            I contacted and tested three participants: a chemistry professor, an undergraduate studying
                            biology and chemistry, and an undergraduate studying UX design. Including the participants
                            I gathered, our team was able to receive results from a total of eight participants. We
                            focused our efforts on finding participants that were educators and/or within the field of
                            chemistry, since the focus of the website was chemistry education.

                            After receiving feedback from our client about the results of our UX testing,
                            we then began working to create the website using Wordpress. My involvement in this
                            process was minimal, and I primarily provided feedback to professor Polifka about design
                            changes I thought would benefit the website.

                        <p>Working on this website was a fantastic opportunity, and taught me how to better communicate

                            a client in order to provide desired results. For example, creating mockups helps the client
                            identify what they do or don’t want to see in the final product, without needing to spend
                            the time and resources to create the full website. Furthermore, card sorting is a very
                            effective method in determining what will make the most sense to the average user,
                            creating a better user experience for more people. </p>

                    <p>This website was created as a proof of concept for how reservations for bowling lanes at
                        Boise State’s Games Center could be made, stored, accessed, and edited online. I developed this
                        website independently for a class.
                        Working on this website expanded my skills with using MySQL as a data storage system, as well as
                        designing a variety of website interfaces.

                    <p>I chose to make a prototype for a reservation system, because at the time of making this website,
                        I was working at BSU’s Games Center, and I had noticed how the reservation system was less
                        efficient than it could have been. So, I attempted to create a website that could
                        streamline the process of both making and storing reservations, simplifying the process
                        for both customers and employees. </p>

                        client to create the Treasure Valley Water Hub website, a centralized resource hub focused on
                        water-related information in Idaho. My role involved working on both the front-end and back-end
                        aspects of the website, collaborating closely with another full-stack developer and the UX/UI
                        designer on our team.

                        Our team was given about three months to complete the initial development, followed by
                        additional work to finalize the project handoff. Using the wireframes designed in Figma by our
                        UX/UI designer, the other developer and I translated the design into a functional and visually
                        engaging website. We maintained consistent communication with the client through weekly
                        meetings, ensuring that their feedback was incorporated into the website's design and
                        functionality with quick turnaround times.

                        Throughout the project, I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with several JavaScript
                        libraries and frameworks, including React.js, Node.js, Leaflet and React-Leaflet, D3.js,
                        Swiper.js, and Simple-Statistics. Although React-Leaflet-Heatmap-Layer and Kriging.js were
                        initially implemented to build a predictive groundwater level map using the Kriging model, these
                        features were ultimately removed when the client determined that the model’s predictions were
                        not accurate enough. This process required significant trial and error to achieve a working
                        prototype before the client’s decision.

                        was done on a scatter plot, a standard bar graph, and a stacked bar graph. On the back-end, I
                        imported several data tables into the project’s MySQL database using MySQL Workbench and crafted
                        MySQL queries to efficiently integrate this data into the website's features.

                        The four of us took inspiration from the game It Takes Two, and how each player has their own
                        unique set of skills, and are only able to get through the levels by working together and using
                        both of their own unique mechanics to help the other player through. As the level designer, I
                        first needed to know what each of the player characters was going to be capable of. So, my group
                        did some brainstorming on the unique mechanics for Slurgin the slug and Snop the snail. While we
                        went through many ideas, we eventually decided that the primary mechanics of Slurgin would be
                        the ability to jump, and the ability to shoot slime.As for Snop, he would be able to climb over
                        objects and roll down slopes to destroy objects and back his shell into enemies. Additionally,
                        Slurgin would be killed by copper but immune to salt, while Snop would be killed by salt but
                        immune to copper.

                        With this decided upon, I was able to begin iterating on the level design, and I sketched out a
                        few different iterations of what the level could look like. I knew from my own experience
                        playing puzzle games like Portal, that it helps to slowly introduce new mechanics and how to use
                        those mechanics to your players. You don’t want to throw too many new things at them at once,
                        otherwise they could get overwhelmed. So, I tried to build out the level in a way that would
                        slowly introduce the players to the mechanics, and show them what they could do with them. While
                        I am not totally satisfied with how the level turned out, I think it was a very helpful learning
                        experience for me.

                        Let's Breath is an iOS Mobile AR Application intended to help aid students with emotional
                        disorders by leading them through breathing exercises and having them journal their thoughts and
                        feelings. It created through the collaboration of students from Missippi State University and
                        Boise State University. My team met with a team of MSU students throughout the semester to
                        develop an application for them that would help aid students with disabilities. Through our
                        initial meetings with them, we learned exactly what kind of app our clients at MSU wanted.

                        For much of this project, I acted as project manager by organizing meetings, leading
                        conversations with our clients, planning our project, and organizing each group member’s
                        responsibilities when developing the app. I also created a wireframe for the app in Adobe XD,
                        which was used to get feedback from the clients. The feedback my team got from each of our
                        initial wireframes allowed us to create a final look for the app that our clients were happy
                        with.

                        When we started on the actual development for the app, I was in charge of getting the face
                        tracking working. I worked with Swift and ARKit in XCode. After talking with our clients in
                        Mississippi, we knew that we wanted the app
                        to include a breathing exercise, and that we wanted to ensure that the kids would actually do
                        the breathing exercise, and not just fake it. So, we decided that using ARKit’s ability to
                        track and recognize facial expressions could be used to make sure the user is doing the
                        breathing exercise.

                        application’s needs. The first thing I did was modify the facePoseAnalyzer() function to check
                        for the
                        two facial expressions we needed: breathing in, and breathing out. The function recognizes both
                        eyebrows being raised as the breathing in facial expression, and a tunneling of the mouth
                        as the breathing out expression.

                        Once I finished my main job, I then moved on to combining the work each of my teammates did into
                        the AR face tracking scene I made. I started with incorporating the breathing animation our
                        artist created of the guardian Momo into the scene. I did this by importing a library called
                        FLAnimatedImage into the XCode project. FLAnimatedImage is used to play GIFs in iOS
                        applications. I created a gifView and added constraints to keep the gif at the bottom center of
                        the screen. Once I had that working, I then worked on incorporating the progress bar our UI
                        designer/programmer created into the AR scene. The progress bar is used to indicate how long the
                        user should be inhaling and exhaling. Once it was in the scene, I worked with the UI designer to
                        style it and get it working properly with the rest of the code.
                    </p>

                <div class='col-md-7'>
                    <p>
                        Finally, I incorporated the work of another programmer, who worked on code that would measure
                        the volume coming in through the microphone and measure it in decibels, into the main project.
                        This code is used to check if the student is in a loud environment, and if it detects that the
                        volume is over a certain threshold, it gives the user a warning and recommends that they move to
                        a quieter space. The other programmer got the code working to where it was able to detect the
                        volume level input, and then print out a warning into the console. When I moved it into the main
                        AR scene, I added a popup that would actually display to the user. With this, I added an option
                        to either continue and let it keep warning you if the environment gets too loud, or the user can
                        select “Ignore Warnings” and prevent the popup from showing up again if they can’t/don’t want to
                        move to a more quiet area but still want to do the breathing exercise.

                    <p>I started this project as a way to learn more about puzzle design in video games when my Senior
                        Capstone class gave me the opportunity to freely choose and dive into a topic I was interested
                        in. I spent time both researching puzzle design, and putting what I learned into practice. This
                        project is very much a work in progress, and I plan to continue to add content, iterate on
                        ideas, and test what I create whenever I can in my free time.

                    <p>I love puzzle games, with some of my favorite video games being puzzle games. So, I wanted to
                        learn how my favorite titles made such fun puzzles, and try my own hand at it. I had tried
                        making puzzle games previously, such as in my game ADRIFT, but I found that I didn’t enjoy the
                        puzzles I created, and had a difficult time iterating on the mechanics I built ADRIFT around.

                <div class='col-md-12'>
                    <p>When I was going into this new project, I initially thought that I would take ADRIFT and improve
                        it, but through my research, I found that in general it is best to approach puzzle design by
                        having a variety of different mechanics that interact with each other in interesting ways. The
                        mechanics I developed for ADRIFT were fairly limited, so I decided to instead start fresh with a
                        new game and new mechanics.

                    <p>
                        Through my research, I also found that the core mechanic of a puzzle game should be something
                        that has a large variety of potential states. So, I started by brainstorming different ideas for
                        a core game mechanic. It was pretty overwhelming to just try and think of something as broad as
                        “can have a lot of different states” so I had to narrow my focus. In ADRIFT, I had a color
                        mixing mechanic that I thought was pretty fun. So, I decided to spin that into something more
                        versatile. I had some vague ideas for mixing different colored liquids and having to move
                        different pipes around to end up with the right concoction, but I was worried that it would take
                        me too long to figure out the mechanics for how to achieve that, and I wouldn’t get to focus on
                        the puzzles design as much.

                    <p>
                        After a few more ideas, I landed on the light beams in my current game. I liked that they felt
                        versatile in that they could be used to change the color of other objects and the beam of light
                        itself could change colors. I also immediately had ideas for additional mechanics that would
                        play well with this, like the mirrors.

                    <p>
                        Once I had an idea I was excited about trying, I got to work on the game and its mechanics. I
                        started with just getting a beam of light working, then bit by bit I added in other
                        functionality and mechanics. I was less concerned with the polish of the game and its mechanics,
                        and more interested in experimenting with how the different mechanics could overlap and work
                        together for puzzles. So that’s what I did. Once I got a few initial mechanics in a
                        working-enough state, I started throwing things together to see what I could do.

                        As I messed with stuff, I also took note of what seemed interesting or like it could be spun
                        into a puzzle. Then, I tried to turn it into a puzzle, while keeping in mind some of the things
                        that make a good puzzle as I found through my research. Once I had a few rooms with puzzles, I
                        started rearranging them to try and build a curve into the game. As I was rearranging, I
                        realized a few times that it would probably be good to have a level that introduced a mechanic
                        that would be used later, so I went back and played around some more until I got a new room that
                        I thought would improve the curve.

                        <li>Improve grab object script to make sure objects can’t phase through walls/floor and also make sure held objects don’t interfere with player’s movement/physics.</li>

                    <p>This was my first video game I developed independently in Unity. Through this project,
                        I learned much about using Unity and programming in C#, as I was only somewhat
                        familiar with Unity and C# prior to making this game. I created several different
                        game mechanics for this game, including platforms that fall away after the player
                        collides with them, meteors that damage the player, and a key item the player must
                        collect in order to complete the second level. I had difficulty making each mechanic
                        work properly, but with each new addition I made to my game, my understanding of Unity and C#
                        grew.

                    <p>The first mechanic I implemented was the falling platforms. While I can look back at
                        my code now and recognize its simplicity, I in fact spent several hours researching how
                        to get the desired outcome. The result was the script FallingPlatform, in which I
                        created a function called killIt() that disables the platform’s rigidbody’s isKinematic
                        by setting it to false, allowing the platform to be affected by the physics of the
                        scene. Then, after half a second, the platform is destroyed. This function is invoked
                        two seconds after the player collides with the platform. This gives the player two
                        seconds to jump off the platform before it falls away from under them. For more
